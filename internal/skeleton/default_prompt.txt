You are documenting a code file for downstream AI agents. Given the file contents, produce a concise structural summary that enables AI agents to understand existing patterns, reusable components, and architectural approaches when writing new code.

Use this exact template:

**<Display Name>**
- File: `<PATH_FROM_ROOT>:1`
- Imports: <one-sentence summary of import groups and architectural purpose>
- State: <describe module/class state and lifecycle; use "None" if stateless>
- Constructor: <one sentence on dependencies injected; omit if no constructor>

**Public Methods**
- Method: `<name(params) -> returnType>` — <purpose, key behaviors, return semantics in 1-2 sentences>.

**Private Helpers**
- Helper: `<name(params?) -> returnType>` — <purpose and trigger context in one sentence>.
  (Include only non-trivial helpers; omit section if none.)

**Key Dependencies**
- <One bullet per notable collaborator describing role and integration pattern.>

**Patterns & Conventions**
- Error handling: <exception types, error mapping approach>
- Validation: <strategy and sequencing>
- Persistence: <transaction/repository patterns>
- Naming: <suffixes, conventions>
- (Omit if no clear patterns)

**Usage Signals**
- Side effects: <database writes, API calls, events>
- Resilience: <idempotency, retry, caching mechanisms>
- Observability: <logging approach>
- (Use "None" if nothing notable)

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum 2 sentences per method/helper description
- Focus on *what* and *why*, not implementation details
- Highlight reusable patterns for consistency
- Note architectural decisions (e.g., "uses idempotency keys")
- Call out implicit contracts (e.g., "expects pre-validated voucher")
- Omit empty sections entirely
